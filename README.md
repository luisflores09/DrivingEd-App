# DrivingEd Front-End Application

DrivingEd-App is a web application designed to streamline the scheduling process for driving schools. It allows students to book driving appointments with instructors conveniently through a browser on their PC or mobile device. 



## Problem Solved

The app addresses the inefficiencies in traditional appointment scheduling methods, such as manual tracking or phone-based bookings, by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform.



## Features

- Student account creation and management.

- Appointment scheduling.

- Integration with calendar tools for better appointment management.

- Basic form validation



## Lessons & Takeaways

Creating DrivingEd-App was an incredible learning experience, as .NET was a completely new framework for me. Through this project, I gained valuable skills in building RESTful APIs using .NET and connecting the back-end to an SQL Server database.
I also learned how to develop single-page applications using Microsoft Blazor, leveraging C# for a seamless front-end experience. Additionally, I was introduced to Azure, where I explored cloud database management and deployment processes.
